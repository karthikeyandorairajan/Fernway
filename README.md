This https://github.com/karthikeyandorairajan/Fernway/ Git Hub repository contains two solutions.
•	FernwayAssessment.sln includes automation scripts to handle different types of alerts available on https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/javascript_alerts
•	FernwayAssessment1.sln includes automation scripts to do CRUD operations on http://computer-database.gatling.io/computers

Automation scripts written using selenium web driver with C#. These scripts can be executed on Chrome browsers. Packages information available in packages .config file. 
I took 4 hours to complete these assessments.
